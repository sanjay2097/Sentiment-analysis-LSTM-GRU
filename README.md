# Sentiment-analysis-LSTM-GRU
### Sentiment analysis is a type of text research aka mining. It applies a mix of statistics, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning to identify and extract subjective information from text files, for instance, a reviewer’s feelings, thoughts, judgments, or assessments about a particular topic, event, or a company and its activities as mentioned above. This analysis type is also known as opinion mining (with a focus on extraction) or affective rating. Some specialists use the terms sentiment classification and extraction as well. Regardless of the name, the goal of sentiment analysis is the same: to know a user or audience opinion on a target object by analyzing a vast amount of text from various sources.

###  Sentiment Analysis With Deep Learning
#### Deep learning is hierarchical machine learning that uses multiple algorithms in a progressive chain of events to solve complex problems and allows you to tackle massive amounts of data, accurately and with very little human interaction.

#### Deep learning and machine learning are sometimes used interchangeably. Deep learning is, indeed, machine learning, but it is more advanced. When basic machine learning makes a mistake, human input is required to correct it – to change the output and “force” the model to learn. In deep learning, however, the neural network can learn to correct itself through its advanced algorithm chain.
